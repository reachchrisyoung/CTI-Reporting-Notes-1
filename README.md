Key Takeaway: Make sure the problem/question is understood.  

Bottom Line (Up Front):

Understand the conflict
Highlight the conflict
Articulate it in a very clear manner

To Illustrate:

If we get out of a meeting – which could even be an hour of our time – and think to ourselves: 

“What in the world was that meeting about?  We didn’t get anywhere or figure anything out!”

Likely Cause (in this illustration):

The presenter didn’t establish a clear conflict that we’re attempting to tackle for that discussion.

Discussion:

When I’m trying to illustrate the problem or situation being encountered – from a cybersecurity perspective – articulate the cause.

How to articulate the cause:

“We’re in this situation because of…[business context][security context].”

Ensure this is put into a clear, tangible manner of conveyance. 

What it means to fail with this:

IF the conflict is not understood…

…THEN: it is likely that we could find ourselves chasing our tail and trying to get “something” – and it’s likely that no one really knows what that something is that is attempting to be achieved.


Solution:

We need to understand the “so what” of something – so, in intelligence, put the “so what” upfront.  Use the BLUF method – which stands for…

Bottom
Line
Up
Front

What this achieves:

It articulates “Why this is important.” 


NOTE – After the “so what” portion, it’s the body of the report that can encompass…

+ the justification
+ the details

Bottom Line:

Understand the conflict
Highlight the conflict
Articulate it in a very clear manner

Circumstances for which this same reasoning is suitable for:

Pitches
Meetings/Briefings
Presentations
